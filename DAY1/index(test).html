    <!-- <h1>INTERVIEW QUESTIONS</h1>
    <h2>1. Diff b/w div & span tags</h2>
    <p> div - The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
        The <div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with
        JavaScript.
        The <div> tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
        Any sort of content can be put inside the <div> tag!</p> -->
    <!-- <h2>2. Diff b/w clss & ID's</h2>
    The CSS class Selector :
    The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
    To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name. -->

    <!-- The CSS id Selector :
    The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
    The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
    To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element. -->
